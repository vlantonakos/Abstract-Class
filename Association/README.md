Association means the act of establishing a relationship between two unrelated classes. For example, when you declare two fields of different types (e.g. Car and Bicycle) within the same class and make them interact with each other, you have created an association.

Association in Java:
<ul>
    <li>Two separate classes are associated through their objects</li>
    <li>The two classes are unrelated, each can exist without the other one</li>
    <li>Can be a one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, or many-to-many relationship</li>
</ul>
