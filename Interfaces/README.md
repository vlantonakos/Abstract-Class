# Interfaces
An interface is a 100% abstract class. It can only have static, final, and public fields and abstract methods. Itâ€™s frequently referred to as a blueprint of a class as well. Java interfaces allow you to implement multiple inheritances in your code, as a class can implement any number of interfaces. Classes can access an interface with the implements keyword.
