# Abstract-Class
An abstract class is a superclass (parent class) that cannot be instantiated(=represent as/by an instance). To create a new object, you need to instantiate one of its child classes. Abstract classes can have both abstract and concrete methods. Abstract methods contain only the method signature, while concrete methods declare the method body as well. Abstract classes are defined with the abstract keyword.
