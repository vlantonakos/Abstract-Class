# Inheritance
Inheritance makes it possible to create a child class that inherits the fields and methods of the parent class. The child class can override the values and methods of the parent class, but it’s not necessary. It can also add new data and functionality to its parent.

Parent classes are also called superclasses or base classes, while child classes are known as subclasses or derived classes as well. Java uses the extends keyword to implement the principle of inheritance in code.

Inheritance in Java:
<ul>
    <li> A class (child class) can extend another class (parent class) by inheriting its features </li>
    <li> Implements the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) programming principle </li>
    <li> Improves code reusability </li>
    <li> Multi-level inheritance is allowed in Java (a child class can have its own child class as well) </li>
    <li> Multiple inheritances are not allowed in Java (a class can’t extend more than one class) </li>
</ul>
