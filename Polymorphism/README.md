# Polymorphism
Polymorphism refers to the ability to perform a certain action in different ways. In Java, polymorphism can take two forms: method overloading and method overriding.

Method overloading happens when various methods with the same name are present in a class. When they are called, they are differentiated by the number, order, or types of their parameters. Method overriding occurs when a child class overrides a method of its parent.

Polymorphism in Java:
<ul>
  <li>The same method name is used several times</li>
    <li>Different methods of the same name can be called from an object</li>
    <li>All Java objects can be considered polymorphic (at the minimum, they are of their own type and instances of the Object class)</li>
    <li>Static polymorphism in Java is implemented by method overloading</li>
    <li>Dynamic polymorphism in Java is implemented by method overriding</li>
</ul>
